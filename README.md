Cross-validation is a valuable methodology for assessing the generalizability of statistical analyses to independent data. In the realm of predictive modeling, it typically entails the division of data into two distinct sets: the training dataset, which contains known values and is used for model training, and the validation dataset (often called the testing set), which comprises unknown values that the model hasn't been exposed to during training. This approach helps gauge how effectively the model's insights can be applied to new, unseen data, ensuring robustness in its predictive capabilities.
